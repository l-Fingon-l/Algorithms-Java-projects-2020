1) Make a MinPQ and add all the letters with their frequencies to create a Node forest.
2) Repeat the next steps until there are more than 2 Nodes left in the PQ:
    ~ delete 3 minimum Nodes;
    ~ add a new Node with a frequency that is a sum of the 3 Nodes we just got to the PQ;
3) We get the Huffman code the moment we terminate. The proof is the same as for binary alphabet.
